					<h1>High Level Concepts</h1>
					<h3>Object Oriented Design</h3>
					<p>Object oriented systems are composed of a myriad array of objects communicating 
						by sending messages to exposed interfaces. To a large degree, the qualities of 
						an OO design are determined by the structure, organization, and responsibility 
						assignments of the objects in a system.&nbsp; The qualities of a system most 
						affected by structure are flexibility, extensibility, maintainability, and 
						testability.&nbsp; Applications usually meet their demise when the system is 
						determined to be too difficult or costly to change. The symptoms of a dying 
						application are a loss of clearly defined structure,&nbsp;an unclear division 
						of&nbsp;responsibilities in the code,&nbsp;and difficulty&nbsp;testing and 
						troubleshooting the application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
					<P>Over the years a series of rules and principles have been discovered and 
						developed to describe well-structured systems.&nbsp; Possibly most important is <EM>
							Separation of Concerns</EM> – pulling separate aspects of the system like 
						persistence, security, or business logic&nbsp;into separate classes and 
						packages.&nbsp; Another key concept is the combination of highly cohesive 
						classes in a loosely coupled structure. The more highly coupled two components 
						of a system are, the more difficult the system is to maintain, test, and reuse. 
						A class should have a cohesive set of responsibilities in a narrow 
						domain.&nbsp; In other words, simpleton classes that do only one thing are much 
						easier to code and test than <EM>God</EM> classes that take on far too many 
						unrelated responsibilities.&nbsp;
					</P>
					<P>By itself, StructureMap does not improve an application.&nbsp; StructureMap 
						simply makes using good design techniques for structuring an application 
						easier.</P>
					<h3>Impact of Test Driven Development and Emergent Design</h3>
					<p>The advent of Test Driven Development (TDD) techniques and emergent design 
						methodologies like Extreme Programming has refined the way that we build OO 
						systems.&nbsp; Taking an evolutionary approach to OO design and structure is 
						best accomplished through supple code.&nbsp; The desire to express design 
						through automated unit tests requires and enforces a very fine grained approach 
						to class design.&nbsp; Both practices are maximized by loose coupling between 
						classes.</p>
					<P>
						Another wrinkle is the desire to test classes either in isolation or in small 
						clusters of classes. Because each class is small, it depends on many of its 
						neighboring classes to provide services in order to accomplish anything.&nbsp; 
						In order to truly test a class in isolation, TDD practitioners use <a href="Concepts.htm#stub">
							Service Stub</a> objects&nbsp;or <a href="Concepts.htm#_Mock_Object">Mock 
							Objects</a> as stand-ins for the external dependencies of the class being 
						tested. Utilizing these testing techniques requires a mechanism to substitute 
						the dependencies at runtime. The responsibility for discovering and attaching 
						dependencies can be removed from a class to maximize testing automation 
						opportunities. Much of the goal of StructureMap or any IoC container is to 
						provide an easy mechanism to attach and assemble dependency chains.</P>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Building Blocks of Object Oriented Programming</h3>
					<p>At the coding level, the building blocks of an object oriented design are 
						encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance. Encapsulation is important for 
						the sake of loose coupling.&nbsp; As an example from classic 3-tier systems, a 
						user interface object calls a business logic object that will in turn call 
						database access objects to persist new data. The UI code should not need to be 
						bound to any kind of database engine or really know anything about how the 
						business objects process the requests.&nbsp; Using encapsulation, the UI code 
						does not have to be so tightly coupled to the internal mechanisms of the 
						business logic code. On the other hand, we want the dependencies of the 
						business logic objects to be externally attached to enable reuse and testing, 
						so how does the UI code create and utilize the business logic without breaking 
						encapsulation? One answer is separate constructor functions on the business 
						logic classes, one for testing and one for production. Another alternative is 
						to use an IoC container like StructureMap to instantiate and assemble the 
						business logic objects.&nbsp; The UI code only needs to ask StructureMap for an 
						instance of the business logic type.</p>
					<p>Polymorphism is the ability for multiple objects to be interchangeable by 
						exposing the same interface.&nbsp; Polymorphism is the single most important 
						abstraction technique in object oriented design.&nbsp; By making a class 
						dependent on a public interface, the class should be able to work with multiple 
						implementations of the interface.&nbsp; The extensibility of a system is 
						greatly improved with the ability to <i><a href="Concepts.htm#_Plugin_Pattern_(Fowler)">
								plugin</a></i> a new implementation class into an existing interface 
						slot. Mock objects and service stubs use polymorphic interfaces to allow the 
						real functionality to be replaced with hard-coded testing implementations for 
						automated testing in isolation. Polymorphism is an abstraction however. At some 
						point the proper implementation of an interface needs to be created and 
						attached to the necessary calling classes.&nbsp; A common technique in TDD is 
						to use an interface as a point of abstraction to enable mock objects in order 
						to isolate a class for testing.&nbsp; StructureMap can be used as a generic 
						mechanism to utilize polymorphic instances as an alternative to hard-coded <i>factory</i>
						and <i>builder</i> classes.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Inversion of Control (IoC) Containers</h3>
					<p>Inversion of Control containers like StructureMap, PicoContainer, and Spring are 
						an attempt to improve OO designs by minimizing the effort necessary to utilize 
						existing OO techniques. The <EM>Inversion of Control</EM> moniker refers to the 
						indirection of object instantiation and linkage. Objects do not directly create 
						and call other objects, StructureMap "injects" dependencies into an object 
						instance through the object's constructor or public properties.</p>
					<P>StructureMap is not really a "Container" of anything except the knowledge of 
						which classes to create for a requested interface.&nbsp; The term "Container" 
						originates from the J2EE world when the early IoC frameworks were considered to 
						be simple, lightweight replacements for heavier J2EE application servers.&nbsp; 
						StructureMap does not track created instances or manage instance lifecycle like 
						most of the Java IoC Containers.</P>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3><A name="DI"></A>Dependency&nbsp;Injection / Inversion of Control (IoC)</h3>
					<p>In a well-factored OO design, a class may have dependencies on other classes to 
						perform useful tasks. These dependencies can be attached in roughly two ways, 
						the class can create its own dependencies, or the dependencies can be 
						“injected” into the class instance.&nbsp; Removing the responsibility for 
						creating dependencies from a class is called Dependency Injection, or Inversion 
						of Control.</p>
					<P>
						Dependency Injection has a couple of variants.&nbsp; The dependencies can be 
						attached by either setting properties&nbsp;or using a constructor function to 
						setup all dependencies at instantiation. StructureMap primarily uses the <EM>Constructor 
							Injection</EM> variant of IoC. The advantage of this method is a guarantee 
						that the proper dependencies are setup before any execution can take place on 
						the new class instance.&nbsp;The constructor function can become a contract 
						stating the dependencies of one class on the services provided by other 
						classes. &nbsp;Another advantage is a streamlining of a classes public 
						interface by negating the need for public <i>setter</i> properties.&nbsp;</P>
					<P>New in version 0.90 is the ability to use <EM>Setter Injection</EM> as 
						well.&nbsp; This is particularly important when using StructureMap to configure 
						and create class objects that are external to your application code.</P>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3><a name="_Plugin_Pattern_(Fowler)"></a>Plugin Pattern (Fowler)</h3>
					<p>This pattern refers to a mechanism of creating an object instance of a certain 
						interface at runtime.&nbsp; The actual configuration and implementation of the 
						instance is usually controlled by external configuration.&nbsp; Using a Plugin 
						pattern allows a new class to be “plugged” into an existing codebase without 
						modifications to the existing code.&nbsp; StructureMap can be used as a generic 
						Plugin mechanism.&nbsp; This pattern is very common in application frameworks.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Memento Pattern (GoF)</h3>
					<p>A Memento pattern is an object that models the internal state of another object 
						instance.&nbsp; The purpose of a Memento is to externalize the configuration of 
						an object instance so the object can be recreated with the same state at a 
						later time. Another way to think of a Memento is as a dehydrated object.&nbsp; 
						Just add just runtime water, and presto, an object instance of the same 
						configuration.&nbsp; The intrinsic Xml and binary serialization capabilities of 
						.NET are examples of the Memento pattern in .NET.&nbsp; StructureMap uses the 
						Memento pattern to store configuration information.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3><a name="_Open/Closed_Principle"></a>Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</h3>
					<p><EM>A module should be open for extension but closed for modification</EM></p>
					<p>Software systems are never completed, only abandoned when the ability to change 
						or extend a system is compromised by poor structure or amount of rework 
						necessary to implement the new changes.&nbsp; In situations where system 
						requirements will be changing, the Open/Closed Principle can be utilized in 
						conjunction with a Plugin pattern to extend an existing codebase by adding a 
						new module with minimal or no changes to existing code.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
					<P>OCP is frequently employed in user interface frameworks.&nbsp; Using OCP, new 
						screens and menu commands could be added to the user interface by configuring 
						the application to use the new classes without changing existing code.&nbsp; 
						Another common example would be adding security rules or business rules to 
						frequently changing application.</P>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3><a name="_Dependency_Inversion_Principle"></a>Dependency Inversion Principle 
						(DIP)</h3>
					<p><i>Depend upon Abstractions. &nbsp;Do not depend upon concretions</i></p>
					<p>Simply put, the Dependency Inversion Principle is about creating a firebreak 
						around volatile or simply difficult to test modules.&nbsp; Using DIP removes a 
						direct coupling between two classes, enabling the usage of mock objects, 
						service stubs, and different implementations of the dependency.&nbsp; In a TDD 
						process, DIP is often used for no other purpose than to facilitate automated 
						unit testing.&nbsp; A common example from the .NET Framework is the IDb* 
						interfaces in ADO.NET.&nbsp; Building a system around the abstract interfaces 
						instead of Oracle or Sql Server classes avoids a tight coupling to a specific 
						database.engine.</p>
					<P>&nbsp;</P>
					<h3><a name="stub"></a>Service Stub</h3>
					<p><i>Removes dependence upon problematic services during testing.</i></p>
					<p>A Service Stub replaces an external dependency with a static stand-in 
						object.&nbsp; Service Stub's are typically used to hard code return 
						values.&nbsp; A classic example would be a data access class that returns a 
						DataSet.&nbsp; A Service Stub for this object might return a DataSet read from 
						a static&nbsp;file instead of pulling the information from a database.&nbsp; 
						During testing, the data returned by the data access interface would always be 
						known, so that the processed outcome of the data from other classes should also 
						be static -- facilitating automated testing.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3><a name="_Mock_Object"></a>Mock Object</h3>
					<p><i>A debug replacement for a real-world object</i></p>
					<p>A <i>mock object</i> is particularly useful for dependencies on external systems 
						that are difficult to test.&nbsp; Mock objects enable the runtime replacement 
						of a real object that might be slow, difficult to setup, 
						or&nbsp;non-deterministic with a&nbsp;well behaved “Mocked” object that behaves 
						in a known way.&nbsp; The goal of mocking is to test one 
						class&nbsp;independently, even though it cannot function without interacting 
						with&nbsp;the class's dependencies.&nbsp;</p>
					<P>StructureMap was largely developed&nbsp;during a WinForms "Smart Client" 
						project.&nbsp; The user interface used a <EM>Model-View-Controller</EM> design 
						for all screens.&nbsp; Each controller class interacted with a view, and other 
						classes like web service proxies and object caches.&nbsp; In unit testing for a 
						typical controller class, both the view and web service proxies would be mock 
						objects to test the controller interfaction with its dependencies.</P>
					<P>Mock objects are active participants in the testing process.&nbsp; StructureMap 
						directly supports using the NMock framework for dynamically mocking 
						classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;StructureMap can also inject static mocks or stubs at 
						runtime.&nbsp;</P>
