To start using StructureMap, either use the DLL's in the build folder or click on the RunBuild.BAT file to run the full NAnt build.  There is a known issue with the build "sticking" on the custom NAnt tasks.  If this happens, delete the copies of StructureMap.Dll and StructureMap.DeploymentTasks.Dll in the bin\NAnt folder.

A copy of the StructureMap website and documentation is in the "Docs" folder.


Contact jeremydmiller@yahoo.com with any questions or bugs.

The latest code and documentation is available on SourceForge:

Thanks for trying StructureMap.
